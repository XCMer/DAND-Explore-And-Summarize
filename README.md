# DAND - Explore and Summarize

The knitted report is in `explore.html` file. The original source code is in `explore.Rmd`. I've not included the original wine dataset in this repo. However, the code assumes that the file `wineQualityReds.csv` (obtained from https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityReds.csv) be present in the same folder as `explore.Rmd`.
